# magic-hexagon

Thank you so much for checking this code out. 
Have a look at my blogpost about it here: https://srcassini.github.io/posts/hexagon/

It's best to open the python file in interpretable mode, i.e:

python -i magic_hexagon_solver.py

so that you can try out different population sizes and candidate ratios
